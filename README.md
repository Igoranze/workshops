Some simple python workshop programs

## Fibonacci
The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.

The 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1)
The 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2),
And the 5 is (2+3),
and so on!

## Hangman
Hangman is a quick and easy game for at least two people that requires nothing more than paper, a pencil, and the ability to spell.
One player, the "host," makes up a secret word, while the other player tries to guess the word by asking what letters it contains.

However, every wrong guess brings them one step closer to losing.
Hangman can also be customized to make the game easier, harder, or educational, and there are apps and websites to play online if you would like.

## Tic Tac Toe
A simple game using a small 3X3 graph of empty boxes.
Players alternate turns by placing a single 'X' or 'O' into an empty box.
The first player to get 3 X's or O's lined up horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game (a line is often drawn through the 3 winning icons).
If each player is smart enough the game will always end in a draw, otherwise known as a "cat's-tail".
